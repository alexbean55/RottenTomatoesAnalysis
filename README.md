# RottenTomatoesAnalysis

This project investigates semi-supervised learning techniques for multiclass sentiment analysis using a dataset based on Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews. The dataset, available on Kaggle as a midterm project (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cs-5785-orie-5750-ece-5414-midterm-project), includes three files: train.csv, val.csv, and test.csv, each containing input text data (X) and sentiment labels (y). In the train.csv file, 60% of labels are missing (indicated by -100), while 40% are valid, ranging from 0 to 4. The val.csv file contains only valid labels, serving as a basis for tuning model hyperparameters before final testing on Kaggle, where participants are allowed up to 20 submissions per day. The project has two parts: first, using unsupervised, supervised, or hybrid methods to generate labels for unlabeled data, and second, training a supervised model on the augmented dataset to evaluate sentiment classification performance improvements. By applying both supervised and unsupervised techniques, the project aligns with recent class topics and provides hands-on experience in a realistic setting. Certain restrictions apply, such as limits on manual labeling and data source integrity.
